        <h1>Interaction data</h1>
Interactions for each of the input species should be loaded in the SIF format. Each line should provide the following three fields for
one particular interaction:<br>
        proteinLabel1 probability proteinLabel2
        <br>
        Where the probability is a real number ranging from 0 to 1.
        In general the probability value is used to filter out less confident
interactions to improve the clarity of the network and efficiency of
the analysis. A threshold for the probability value is determined by
the user before loading the data. A lower threshold can usually be
selected for the root network because it is small and has less edges
(one node summarizes an entire family of proteins) so it can be
displayed without compromising performance. For larger networks a
higher threshold should be used.
